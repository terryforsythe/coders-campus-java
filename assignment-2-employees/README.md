Assignment 2 - Employees
-----

> You will need to develop a system that can track employee information for two Organizations (Google and Microsoft). 

> The Employee information you must track is as follows:

> * Name
* Sex
* Job Title
* Organization they work for
* Birthdate

> As for the Organization that the Employee works for, you must also track this information:

> * Organization Name
* Number of Employees

> The system must be able to properly compare any two employees against each other to determine if they are the same Person. This means that if you compared two People with the same Name, Sex, Birthday and Organization, the system should think that they are equals to one another. If any of these properties are different, then the two People are not the same Person.

> The same rules apply to comparing Organizations to one another. Organizations with the same Organization name are to be thought of as equal, different names means different organizations.
